# TODO LIST:

## New Compiler:

- Implement global variables.
- Implement macros.
- Implement procedures.
- Implement precompilation.
- Implement local labels.
- Implement goto.
- Add types for let variables.
- Implement types.
- Implement more complex patterns of scopes.
- Implement a optimization model.

## Libraries:

- Rewrite string library.
- Remake core library macros to take advantage of precompilation.
- Remove malloc.sew and remake malloc.free.
- Remake queue64.sort and implement quick sort.
- Add mmap and remake malloc and mfree using mmap.
- I/O macro and procedures should be rewritten for performance reasons.
- Create an OS or path library that allows path operations like merging or splitting.
- Create a dictionary library.
- Create a vector library.
- Most of ./libs/memory.corth macro and procedures would be more efficient if they worked with pointers and not indexes.
- Add the information about the time complexity to collection libraries.

## Other:

- Make a test library.
